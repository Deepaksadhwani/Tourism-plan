# React Mini-Project Showcase

This React mini-project combines core React concepts with Tailwind CSS for responsive design. It presents seven tour destination cards, focusing on simplicity and readability. Users can effortlessly remove unwanted destinations with a click, while the UI dynamically refreshes for a smooth browsing experience. This project is for learning React fundamentals.

## Detailed Description

This project was created with the primary goal of understanding and practicing React concepts. By building a mini-project that incorporates fundamental React principles, such as component composition, state management, and event handling, I aimed to strengthen my understanding of React development. Additionally, integrating Tailwind CSS for styling allowed me to explore modern CSS techniques and enhance the project's visual appeal.
